### Introduction

The data visualization that I chose to critique is the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's 2021-23 budget chart. I found this chart on the [WDFW's operating budget page](https://wdfw.wa.gov/about/administration/budget/operating) of their website.

### What is the story?

### How effective is the visualization?

### Is the visualization misleading?

### How well does the visualization hold up visualization principles?

### How could the visualization be improved?

### Why does my version improve the visualization?
